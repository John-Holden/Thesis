Aims:
    - show how to construct a continuum-based large-scale model from the sub-grid
    - show that local dispersal modelling is insufficient to describe 40-60km/yr spread
    - set the scene for future work

MVP:
    - outline a continuum sub-grid-based model and give biological interpretations of wave-front
    - FKPP simulations over UK
    - Set the basis for future study 

Beyond MVP:
     - Show how density reductions ahead of the wave-front can slow/contain the spread of disease
