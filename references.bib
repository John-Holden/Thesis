abstract = {Abstract High-quality abundance data are expensive and time-consuming to collect and often highly limited in availability. Nonetheless, accurate, high-resolution abundance distributions are essential for many ecological applications ranging from species conservation to epidemiology. Producing models that can predict abundance well, with good resolution over large areas, has therefore been an important aim in ecology, but poses considerable challenges. We present a two-stage approach to modeling abundance, combining two established techniques. First, we produce ensemble species distribution models (SDMs) of trees in Great Britain at a fine resolution, using much more common presence–absence data and key environmental variables. We then use random forest regression to predict abundance by linking the results of the SDMs to a much smaller amount of abundance data. We show that this method performs well in predicting the abundance of 20 of 25 tested British tree species, a group that is generally considered challenging for modeling distributions due to the strong influence of human activities. Maps of predicted tree abundance for the whole of Great Britain are provided at 1 km2 resolution. Abundance maps have a far wider variety of applications than presence-only maps, and these maps should allow improvements to aspects of woodland management and conservation including analysis of habitats and ecosystem functioning, epidemiology, and disease management, providing a useful contribution to the protection of British trees. We also provide complete R scripts to facilitate application of the approach to other scenarios.},

abstract = {Bubonic plague (Yersinia pestis) is generally thought of as a historical disease; however, it is still responsible for around 1000–3000 deaths each year worldwide. This paper expands the analysis of a model for bubonic plague that encompasses the disease dynamics in rat, flea and human populations. Some key variables of the deterministic model, including the force of infection to humans, are shown to be robust to changes in the basic parameters, although variation in the flea searching efficiency, and the movement rates of rats and fleas will be considered throughout the paper. The stochastic behaviour of the corresponding metapopulation model is discussed, with attention focused on the dynamics of rats and the force of infection at the local spatial scale. Short–lived local epidemics in rats govern the invasion of the disease and produce an irregular pattern of human cases similar to those observed. However, the endemic behaviour in a few rat subpopulations allows the disease to persist for many years. This spatial stochastic model is also used to identify the criteria for the spread to human populations in terms of the rat density. Finally, the full stochastic model is reduced to the form of a probabilistic cellular automaton, which allows the analysis of a large number of replicated epidemics in large populations. This simplified model enables us to analyse the spatial properties of rat epidemics and the effects of movement rates, and also to test whether the emergent metapopulation behaviour is a property of the local dynamics rather than the precise details of the model. }

abstract = {Spatial structure is of central importance in the dynamics of plant-parasite interactions and is imposed by the growth habit and distribution of host plants and by parasite dispersal which is frequently restricted. To investigate the effects of spatial heterogeneity on the dynamics of plant parasites we introduce a simple model for epidemic development within a spatially structured host population. Here the host population is subdivided into a number of patches which are linked to allow for transmission from one patch to another with the connections defining the spatial structure of the host population. Three key parameters are identified that play a critical role in the ability of the parasite to invade and persist within the host population: the within-patch parasite basic reproductive number which characterises the infection dynamics at the local spatial scale; and the neighbourhood of interaction which describes which patches interact with which and the strength of coupling between patches within the neighbourhood which together characterise the spread of the parasite over larger spatial scales. Using both deterministic and stochastic formulations of the model, we investigate how the thresholds and probabilities of invasion and persistence are affected by these parameters, by demographic stochasticity and by differences in the initial level of infection.},

Here we use a stochastic metapopulation model for the transmission of infection in a spatially structured host population. There are three qualitatively different regimes for the extinction time, which depend on patch population size, the within-patch basic reproductive number and the strength of coupling between patches. In the first regime, the extinction time for the metapopulation (i.e. from all patches) is approximately equal to the extinction time for a single patch. In the second regime, the metapopulation extinction time is maximal but also highly variable. In the third regime, the extinction time for the metapopulation (TE) is given by TE = a + bn1/2 where a is the local extinction time (i.e. from last patch), b is the transit time (i.e. the time taken for infection to spread from one patch to another) and n is the total number of patches.},

Here, an analytical model is developed to consider the variation and, hence, the persistence of stochastic metapopulations. This model relies on a novel moment closure technique, which is equivalent to assuming log-normal distributions for the population sizes. 2. Single-species models show the greatest persistence when the mixing between subpopulations is large, so spatial heterogeneity is of no benefit. This result is confirmed by stochastic simulation of the full metapopulation. 3. In contrast, natural-enemy models exhibit the greatest persistence for intermediate levels of coupling. When the coupling is too low, there are insufficient rescue effects between the subpopulations to sustain the dynamics, whereas when the coupling is too high all spatial heterogeneity is lost. 4. The difference in behaviour between the one- and two-species models can be attributed to the oscillatory nature of the natural-enemy system.},

abstract="Subgrid scale modeling attempts to calculate details of the large scales while parameterizing the effects of small scales on these explicitly retained large scales statistically. Its origins go back to the meteorologists who, in their numerical integration of geophysical-scale flows, found it necessary to introduce an eddy viscosity, which provided an essential numerical stabilization and represented physically the damping by eddies smaller than the computational grid size. For example, Phillips [1] in one of the first numerical experiments treating the general circulation of the atmosphere introduced an eddy viscosity A, whose value was chosen in accordance with Richardson's [2] empirical law, A = 0.2 ($\Delta$x)4/3. Here $\Delta$x is the grid spacing, and the numerical factor of 0.2 implies a value of energy dissipation ϵ such that $\alpha$ϵ1/3 = 0.2 cm2/3/s, where $\alpha$ is Kolmogorov's constant, ≃ 1.7. We recall here that Richardson's law pertains to the dispersion of a pair of particles convected by turbulence, and the diffusion coefficient for this process was shown by Taylor [3] to be equal to the eddy conductivity coefficient. Again, Malkus and Witt [4] in their modeling of a convective cell used the same --- and by conventional standards quite small ---Austausch coefficient in order to parameterize only that part of the turbulent transfer effected by scales of motion smaller than the convective elements studied. In most of these early efforts, ϵ, the flux of energy transferred from large to small subgrid scales was taken constant, independent of space or time. The idea that the eddy viscosity should be a function of the local large scale dynamics was introduced by Smagorinsky [5] and by Lilly [6], who proposed that A be proportional to the local, absolute magnitude, of the strain tensor.",

abstract = "Infectious disease outbreaks in plants threaten ecosystems, agricultural crops and food trade. Currently, several fungal diseases are affecting forests worldwide, posing a major risk to tree species, habitats and consequently ecosystem decay. Prediction and control of disease spread are difficult, mainly due to the complexity of the interaction between individual components involved. In this work, we introduce a lattice-based epidemic model coupled with a stochastic process that mimics, in a very simplified way, the interaction between the hosts and pathogen. We studied the disease spread by measuring the propagation velocity of the pathogen on the susceptible hosts. Our quantitative results indicate the occurrence of a critical transition between two stable phases: local confinement and an extended epiphytotic outbreak that depends on the density of the susceptible individuals. Quantitative predictions of epiphytotics are performed using the framework early-warning indicators for impending regime shifts, widely applied on dynamical systems. These signals forecast successfully the outcome of the critical shift between the two stable phases before the system enters the epiphytotic regime. Our study demonstrates that early-warning indicators could be useful for the prediction of forest disease epidemics through mathematical and computational models suited to more specific pathogen–host-environmental interactions. Our results may also be useful to identify a suitable planting density to slow down disease spread and in the future, design highly resilient forests."

Here, we report two field experiments designed to measure disease gradients caused by sexually- and asexually-produced spores of the wind-dispersed banana plant fungus Mycosphaerella fijiensis. Gradients were measured during a single generation and over 272 traps installed up to 1000 m along eight directions radiating from a traceable source of inoculum composed of fungicide-resistant strains. We adjusted several kernels differing in the shape of their tail and tested for two types of anisotropy. Contrasting dispersal kernels were observed between the two types of spores. For sexual spores (ascospores), we characterized both a steep gradient in the first few metres in all directions and rare long-distance dispersal (LDD) events up to 1000 m from the source in two directions. A heavy-tailed kernel best fitted the disease gradient. Although ascospores distributed evenly in all directions, average dispersal distance was greater in two different directions without obvious correlation with wind patterns. For asexual spores (conidia), few dispersal events occurred outside of the source plot. A gradient up to 12.5 m from the source was observed in one direction only. Accordingly, a thin-tailed kernel best fitted the disease gradient, and anisotropy in both density and distance was correlated with averaged daily wind gust.

We use mathematical modelling to show how control of such disease outbreaks can be optimised. Although our methods and analyses are generic, we use the attempted eradication of citrus canker from Florida (1996–2006) as a case study, and focus upon the performance of reactive culling (i.e. removal of all host plants within a certain distance of detected infection). We show how the cull radius can be optimised, even when there is significant cryptic infection (i.e. infection without visible symptoms). The inherent randomness of disease transmission implies a control strategy can lead to a number of outcomes: the optimal strategy therefore depends on the level of risk that is tolerable. We also consider balancing local vs. global impacts of disease. We show how it can be optimal to control initial outbreaks very extensively, even though this would lead to many local removals, since timely local eradication reduces the risk of a devastating large-scale epidemic. Our model is available as an interactive, user-friendly interface at http://www.webidemics.com/, intended to illustrate the sometimes counter-intuitive epidemiological principles that underlie successful disease control.},

This means that certain preoccupations of plant disease modellers are similar to those of modellers of diseases in human, livestock and wild animal populations. However, a number of aspects of plant epidemiology are very distinctive, and this leads to specific challenges in modelling plant diseases, which in turn sets a certain agenda for modellers. Here we outline a selection of 13 challenges, specific to plant disease epidemiology, that we feel are important targets for future work."

    abstract = { We present a model of a control programme for a disease outbreak in a population of livestock holdings. Control is achieved by culling infectious holdings when they are discovered and by the pre–emptive culling of livestock on holdings deemed to be at enhanced risk of infection. Because the pre–emptive control programme cannot directly identify exposed holdings, its implementation will result in the removal of both infected and uninfected holdings. This leads to a fundamental trade–off: increased levels of control produce a greater reduction in transmission by removing more exposed holdings, but increase the number of uninfected holdings culled. We derive an expression for the total number of holdings culled during the course of an outbreak and demonstrate that there is an optimal control policy, which minimizes this loss. Using a metapopulation model to incorporate local clustering of infection, we examine a neighbourhood control programme in a locally spreading outbreak. We find that there is an optimal level of control, which increases with increasing basic reproduction ratio, R0; moreover, implementation of control may be optimal even when R0\&lt; 1. The total loss to the population is relatively insensitive to the level of control as it increases beyond the optimal level, suggesting that over–control is a safer policy than under–control. }

abstract = "The nature of pathogen transport mechanisms strongly determines the spatial pattern of disease and, through this, the dynamics and persistence of epidemics in plant populations. Up to recently, the range of possible mechanisms or interactions assumed by epidemic models has been limited: either independent of the location of individuals (mean-field models) or restricted to local contacts (between nearest neighbours or decaying exponentially with distance). Real dispersal processes are likely to lie between these two extremes, and many are well described by long-tailed contact kernels such as power laws. We investigate the effect of different spatial dispersal mechanisms on the spatio-temporal spread of disease epidemics by simulating a stochastic Susceptible-infective model motivated by previous data analyses. Both long-term stationary behaviour (in the presence of a control or recovery process) and transient behaviour (which varies widely within and between epidemics) are examined. We demonstrate the relationship between epidemic size and disease pattern (characterized by spatial autocorrelation), and its dependence on dispersal and infectivity parameters. Special attention is given to boundary effects, which can decrease disease levels significantly relative to standard, periodic geometries in cases of long-distance dispersal. We propose and test a definition of transient duration which captures the dependence of transients on dispersal mechanisms. We outline an analytical approach that represents the behaviour of the spatially-explicit model, and use it to prove that the epidemic size is predicted exactly by the mean-field model (in the limit of an infinite system) when dispersal is sufficiently long ranged (i.e. when the power-law exponent a⩽2)."

abstract = "We develop and analyse a flexible compartmental model of the interaction between a plant host, a soil-borne pathogen and a microbial antagonist, for use in optimising biological control. By extracting invasion and persistence thresholds of host, pathogen and biological control agent, performing an equilibrium analysis, and numerical investigation of sensitivity to parameters and initial conditions, we determine criteria for successful biological control. We identify conditions for biological control (i) to prevent a pathogen entering a system, (ii) to eradicate a pathogen that is already present and, if that is not possible, (iii) to reduce the density of the pathogen. Control depends upon the epidemiology of the pathogen and how efficiently the antagonist can colonise particular habitats (i.e. healthy tissue, infected tissue and/or soil-borne inoculum). A sharp transition between totally effective control (i.e. eradication of the pathogen) and totally ineffective control can follow slight changes in biologically interpretable parameters or to the initial amounts of pathogen and biological control agent present. Effective biological control requires careful matching of antagonists to pathosystems. For preventative/eradicative control, antagonists must colonise susceptible hosts. However, for reduction in disease prevalence, the range of habitat is less important than the antagonist's bulking-up efficiency."

abstract = "Few investigations on host diversification at the landscape scale to control plant disease in agricultural systems are available in the literature. At this scale, landscape connectivity measures how the landscape structure facilitates or impedes the disease spread among host patches. We developed a simulation model, giving a particular attention to the representation of the landscape structures, and we characterized the landscape connectivity by the proportion and the aggregation level of the host varieties, the ability for the pathogen to develop on each host and its ability to disperse. The pathogen dynamics was represented by a matrix population model designed for a generic air-borne foliar disease. This framework was used to establish a detailed assessment of the influence of each landscape connectivity variable on the pathogen population dynamics. When deploying a host with complete resistance to the pathogen along with a susceptible host, mixed landscapes were always found to be more efficient to hamper the disease spread. However, when using a quantitatively resistant host, aggregating the hosts in different regions could result in a better control of the pathogen spread, depending on the proportion and level of resistance of the resistant host and according to a source–sink dynamics between the two hosts. The ability of the pathogen to disperse did not change the results from a qualitative point of view. By accounting explicitly for the landscape features, our approach can be used to guide further data analysis or to evaluate the effectiveness of control strategies designed at the landscape scale."

abstract = "Forecasting pest population abundance is a time and resource consuming task, and in particular for area-wide pest management is complicated by demographic and environmental stochasticity. These factors make difficult the development of quantitative tools to design and evaluate different management strategies performances by taking into account various form of variability and uncertainty. Pest management could benefit from methods supporting decision making based on models ease of development under scarce data and high uncertainty. Host plants for many agricultural and forest pests are often patchily distributed, therefore population dynamics can be suitably described in terms of metapopulations. Despite the fact that metapopulation models were originally proposed for pests, they remain a widely used tool in conservation biology but receive little attention in large scale pest management. The aim of this paper is to propose a framework allowing the ranking of the efficacy of area-wide pest control strategies, taking into account population spatial distribution in discrete patches. The Kullback–Leibler divergence, well known in Information Theory, Probability and Statistics, is used to measure how far the state of the metapopulation as predicted by a spatially explicit metapopulation model is from a suitable reference state. The method is applied to compare the efficacy of different types of predefined control strategies of the Pine processionary moth (Traumatocampa pityocampa (Den. and Schiff)). The analysis of a dataset on metapopulation dynamics of this moth from a fragmented Mediterranean pine forest allows to derive some rules of thumb for the rational allocation of control effort, in terms of spatial and temporal distribution of the interventions."

We show that this model, using biologically plausible parameterizations, is capable of mirroring observed data over short timescales such as a decade, but also demonstrates, over century-long timescales, a wide variety of outcomes ranging from pathogen extinction to substantial elm loss. This complexity of outcome from a simple model suggests that a greatly improved understanding of the basic population dynamics of elm and of the epidemiology of the causal fungus is necessary to analyse the future of the elm, the effect of spatial or genetic heterogeneity, or the impact of human interventions. We also use the model to discuss briefly the qualitative evolutionary impact of the combined saprophytic and parasitic stages of the fungal lifecycle. }}

Attempts at managing the disease have been largely unsuccessful. Forty years after the outbreak, however, researchers continue to be interested in both the underlying biology of such a severe and dramatic disease event and in the policy lessons that can be drawn from it. We develop a spatial model at a 1 km2 resolution. Following parameterization to replay the historical epidemic, the model is used to explore previously proposed counterfactual management strategies. A new introduction date of late 1962 is estimated. We show that, even had there been high intervention at a national level in terms of disease management early in the epidemic, there would have been little long-term effect on elm numbers. In Brighton, a local pocket of elm which survived the peak of the initial epidemic has been successfully managed. However, Brighton and similar locations are subject to repeated waves of the disease at a 15- to 20-year intervals following regeneration and reinfection of the surrounding areas, during which much more intensive management is required.},

Invasive tree pests and diseases present some of the greatest global threats to forests, and the recent global acceleration in invasions has caused massive ecological damage 1, 2. Calls to improve biosecurity have, however, often lost out to economic arguments in favour of trade [3]. Human activities, such as trade, move organisms between continents, and interventions to reduce risk of introductions inevitably incur financial costs. No previous studies have attempted to estimate the full economic cost of a tree disease, and the economic imperative to improve biosecurity may have been underappreciated. We set out to estimate the cost of the dieback of ash, Fraxinus excelsior, caused by Hymenoscyphus fraxineus, in Great Britain, and investigate whether this may be the case [4]."

	Abstract = {Crop heterogeneity is a possible solution to the vulnerability of monocultured crops to disease1,2,3. Both theory4 and observation2,3 indicate that genetic heterogeneity provides greater disease suppression when used over large areas, though experimental data are lacking. Here we report a unique cooperation among farmers, researchers and extension personnel in Yunnan Province, China---genetically diversified rice crops were planted in all the rice fields in five townships in 1998 and ten townships in 1999. Control plots of monocultured crops allowed us to calculate the effect of diversity on the severity of rice blast, the major disease of rice5. Disease-susceptible rice varieties planted in mixtures with resistant varieties had 89{\%} greater yield and blast was 94{\%} less severe than when they were grown in monoculture. The experiment was so successful that fungicidal sprays were no longer applied by the end of the two-year programme. Our results support the view that intraspecific crop diversification provides an ecological approach to disease control that can be highly effective over a large area and contribute to the sustainability of crop production.},

Stem rot severity and incidence decreased as plant spacings were increased in 5-cm increments from 5 to 30 cm. Two cultivars with similar susceptibility but different growth habits were compared. Perhaps due to heavy irrigation and extensive vegetative growth, stem rot was similar for ‘Florida MDR-98’ and ‘Georgia Browne’. Plants inoculated later in the year (90 days after planting [DAP]) had less disease at harvest, but often developed more severe symptoms within the first week of inoculation than plants inoculated at 50 or 70 DAP. Canopy microclimate was different than ambient conditions for all treatments; however, differences among treatments were inconsistent and did not explain differences in disease among spacings. Generally, as plant spacing decreased and plant population increased, stem rot increased and tomato spotted wilt was reduced. These data demonstrate that the physical spacing between plants is a critical factor in disease development.}}

Each epidemic has a structure whose temporal dynamics and spatial patterns are jointly determined by the pathosystem characteristics and environmental conditions. One of the important objectives in epidemiology is to understand such spatio-temporal dynamics via mathematical and statistical modelling. In this paper, we outline common methodologies that are used to quantify and model spatio-temporal dynamics of plant diseases, with emphasis on developing temporal forecast models and on quantifying spatial patterns. Several examples of epidemiological models in cereal crops are described, including one for Fusarium head blight.},

@article{cite-key,
	Abstract = {A spatially-explicit, stochastic model is developed for Bahia bark scaling, a threat to citrus production in north-eastern Brazil, and is used to assess epidemiological principles underlying the cost-effectiveness of disease control strategies. The model is fitted via Markov chain Monte Carlo with data augmentation to snapshots of disease spread derived from a previously-reported multi-year experiment. Goodness-of-fit tests strongly supported the fit of the model, even though the detailed etiology of the disease is unknown and was not explicitly included in the model. Key epidemiological parameters including the infection rate, incubation period and scale of dispersal are estimated from the spread data. This allows us to scale-up the experimental results to predict the effect of the level of initial inoculum on disease progression in a typically-sized citrus grove. The efficacies of two cultural control measures are assessed: altering the spacing of host plants, and roguing symptomatic trees. Reducing planting density can slow disease spread significantly if the distance between hosts is sufficiently large. However, low density groves have fewer plants per hectare. The optimum density of productive plants is therefore recovered at an intermediate host spacing. Roguing, even when detection of symptomatic plants is imperfect, can lead to very effective control. However, scouting for disease symptoms incurs a cost. We use the model to balance the cost of scouting against the number of plants lost to disease, and show how to determine a roguing schedule that optimises profit. The trade-offs underlying the two optima we identify-the optimal host spacing and the optimal roguing schedule-are applicable to many pathosystems. Our work demonstrates how a carefully parameterised mathematical model can be used to find these optima. It also illustrates how mathematical models can be used in even this most challenging of situations in which the underlying epidemiology is ill-understood.},

In this century they are gaining increasing attention in the literature and in practical use as a powerful tool to support forest management strategies especially under climate change. In this review paper we consider species occurrence datasets, climatic and soil predictor variables, modelling algorithms, evaluation methods and widely used software for SDM studies. We describe several important and freely available sources for species occurrence and interpolated climatic data. We outline the use of both presence-only and presence/absence modelling algorithms including distance-based algorithms, machine learning algorithms and regression-based models. We conclude that SDM techniques provide a valuable asset for forest managers. However, it is essential to consider uncertainties behind the use of future climate change scenarios."

Connected-component labeling is indispensable for distinguishing different objects in a binary image, and prerequisite for image analysis and object recognition in the image. Therefore, connected-component labeling is one of the most important processes for image analysis, image understanding, pattern recognition, and computer vision. In this article, we review state-of-the-art connected-component labeling algorithms presented in the last decade, explain the main strategies and algorithms, present their pseudo codes, and give experimental results in order to bring order of the algorithms. Moreover, we will also discuss parallel implementation and hardware implementation of connected-component labeling algorithms, extension for n-D images, and try to indicate future work on the connected component labeling problem."

 abstract = {The extent is discussed to which stochastic, as distinct from deterministic, epidemic models are needed in the explanation of large-scale epidemiological phenomena. The possible extinction of infection seems the most relevant factor, as not only does this properly account for the bifurcation in behaviour above the threshold (the principle of which is extended to the host and intermediate vector case), but it gives rise also to the concept of critical community size in the theory of recurrent epidemics such as measles. While deterministic models are adequate for some purposes when extinction is absent, the theoretical study of long-term epidemic patterns may still be impossible without the more complete stochastic versions; this is illustrated by reference to a provisional model for chickenpox.},

We show how epidemiological insights about the dynamics of disease spread can improve the targeting of when and where to sample. We outline some relatively simple but powerful statistical approaches to inform surveillance and describe how they can be adapted to include epidemiological information. This enables us to address questions such as: Following the first report of an invading pathogen, what is the likely incidence of disease? If no cases of disease have been found, how certain can we be that the disease was not simply missed by chance? We illustrate the use of spatially explicit stochastic models to optimize targeting of surveillance and control resources. Finally, we discuss how modern detection and diagnostic technologies as well as information from passive surveillance networks (e.g., citizen science) can be integrated into surveillance strategies. }

We use our statewide model{\textemdash}which has been parameterized to pathogen spread data{\textemdash}to address a number of broadly applicable questions.f How quickly must management start? When is an epidemic too large to prevent further spread effectively? How should local treatment be deployed? How does this depend on the budget and level of risk aversion? Where should treatment be targeted? How should expenditure be balanced on detection and treatment? What if the budget changes over time? The underlying principles are important for management of all plant disease epidemics in natural ecosystems.Sudden oak death, caused by Phytophthora ramorum, has killed millions of oak and tanoak in California since its first detection in 1995. Despite some localized small-scale management, there has been no large-scale attempt to slow the spread of the pathogen in California. Here we use a stochastic spatially explicit model parameterized using data on the spread of P. ramorum to investigate whether and how the epidemic can be controlled. We find that slowing the spread of P. ramorum is now not possible, and has been impossible for a number of years. However, despite extensive cryptic (i.e., presymptomatic) infection and frequent long-range transmission, effective exclusion of the pathogen from large parts of the state could, in principle, have been possible were it to have been started by 2002. This is the approximate date by which sufficient knowledge of P. ramorum epidemiology had accumulated for large-scale management to be realistic. The necessary expenditure would have been very large, but could have been greatly reduced by optimizing the radius within which infected sites are treated and careful selection of sites to treat. In particular, we find that a dynamic strategy treating sites on the epidemic wave front leads to optimal performance. We also find that {\textquotedblleft}front loading{\textquotedblright} the budget, that is, treating very heavily at the start of the management program, would greatly improve control. Our work introduces a framework for quantifying the likelihood of success and risks of failure of management that can be applied to invading pests and pathogens threatening forests worldwide.},

We first use a mean-field approximation to derive analytical results for the optimal treatment regimes that minimize the total cost of the epidemic. We distinguish short- and long-term epidemics. and show that seasonal control (short time scale) requires extreme treatment, either treating all sites or none or switching between the two at some stage during the season. The optimal long-term strategy requires an intermediate level of control that results in near eradication of the disease. We also demonstrate the importance of incorporating economic constraints by deriving a critical relationship between the epidemiological and economic parameters that determine the qualitative nature of the optimal treatment strategy. The set of optimal strategies is summarized in a policy plot, which can be used to determine the nature of the optimal treatment regime given prior knowledge of the epidemiological and economic parameters. Finally, we test the robustness of the analytical results, derived from the mean-field approximation, on the spatially explicit contact process and demonstrate robustness to implementation errors and misestimation of crucial parameters.},

abstract = {The spread of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) in natural environments poses substantial risks to biodiversity and ecosystem function. As EIDs and their impacts grow, landscape- to regional-scale models of disease dynamics are increasingly needed for quantitative prediction of epidemic outcomes and design of practicable strategies for control. Here we use spatio-temporal, stochastic epidemiological modeling in combination with realistic geographical modeling to predict the spread of the sudden oak death pathogen (Phytophthora ramorum) through heterogeneous host populations in wildland forests, subject to fluctuating weather conditions. The model considers three stochastic processes: (1) the production of inoculum at a given site; (2) the chance that inoculum is dispersed within and among sites; and (3) the probability of infection following transmission to susceptible host vegetation. We parameterized the model using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation from snapshots of local- and regional-scale data on disease spread, taking account of landscape heterogeneity and the principal scales of spread. Our application of the model to Californian landscapes over a 40-year period (1990–2030), since the approximate time of pathogen introduction, revealed key parameters driving the spatial spread of disease and the magnitude of stochastic variability in epidemic outcomes. Results show that most disease spread occurs via local dispersal (<250 m) but infrequent long-distance dispersal events can substantially accelerate epidemic spread in regions with high host availability and suitable weather conditions. In the absence of extensive control, we predict a ten-fold increase in disease spread between 2010 and 2030 with most infection concentrated along the north coast between San Francisco and Oregon. Long-range dispersal of inoculum to susceptible host communities in the Sierra Nevada foothills and coastal southern California leads to little secondary infection due to lower host availability and less suitable weather conditions. However, a shift to wetter and milder conditions in future years would double the amount of disease spread in California through 2030. This research illustrates how stochastic epidemiological models can be applied to realistic geographies and used to increase predictive understanding of disease dynamics in large, heterogeneous regions.},

    abstract = { We use a spatially explicit, stochastic model to analyse the effectiveness of different scales of local control strategies in containing the long-term, multi-seasonal spread of a crop disease through a dynamically changing population of susceptible crops in which there is cryptic infection. The model distinguishes between susceptible, infested and symptomatic fields. It is motivated by rhizomania disease on sugar beet in the UK as an exemplar of a spatially structured and partially asymptomatic epidemic. Our results show the importance of matching the scales of local control strategies to prevent intensification and regional spread of disease with the inherent temporal and spatial scales of an epidemic. A simple field-scale containment strategy, whereby the susceptible crop is no longer grown on fields showing symptoms, fails for this system with cryptic infection because the locally applied control lags behind the epidemic. A farm-scale strategy, whereby growers respond to the disease status of neighbouring farms by transferring their quota for sugar beet to farmers in regions of reduced risk, succeeds. We conclude that a soil-borne pathogen such as rhizomania could be managed by movement of susceptible crops in the landscape using a strategy that matches the temporal and spatial scales of the epidemic and which take account of risk aversion among growers. We show some parallels and differences in effectiveness between a ‘culling’ strategy involving crop removal around emerging foci and the local deployment of partially resistant varieties that reduce amplification and transmission of inoculum. Some relationships between the control of plant and livestock diseases are briefly discussed. }

abstract = {Summary Effective control of plant disease remains a key challenge. Eradication attempts often involve removal of host plants within a certain radius of detection, targeting asymptomatic infection. Here we develop and test potentially more effective, epidemiologically motivated, control strategies, using a mathematical model previously fitted to the spread of citrus canker in Florida. We test risk-based control, which preferentially removes hosts expected to cause a high number of infections in the remaining host population. Removals then depend on past patterns of pathogen spread and host removal, which might be nontransparent to affected stakeholders. This motivates a variable radius strategy, which approximates risk-based control via removal radii that vary by location, but which are fixed in advance of any epidemic. Risk-based control outperforms variable radius control, which in turn outperforms constant radius removal. This result is robust to changes in disease spread parameters and initial patterns of susceptible host plants. However, efficiency degrades if epidemiological parameters are incorrectly characterised. Risk-based control including additional epidemiology can be used to improve disease management, but it requires good prior knowledge for optimal performance. This focuses attention on gaining maximal information from past epidemics, on understanding model transferability between locations and on adaptive management strategies that change over time.},

abstract = "The Dutch Elm Disease outbreak of the late 1960s and early 1970s was arguably one of the most dramatic environmental events to affect the British countryside in the last fifty years. The demise of over 28 million elms destroyed the much celebrated, and publicly valued, ‘elmscapes’ of lowland England and brought about extensive habitat loss. During the middle and later phases of the epidemic, the policy response from the UK Forestry Commission, Ministry of Agriculture and local government came to be seen as ‘too little, too late’. Yet forty years after the outbreak it is still unclear whether the epidemic could have been better managed and how far any lessons can be drawn for the way present day disease risks to trees should be tackled. Drawing on the extensively documented (but hitherto unexplored) public record of the outbreak held at Forest Research and the National Archives, together with materials from retrospective interviews conducted by the authors with scientists and policymakers closely involved in the epidemic at the time, this paper presents a fresh analysis of Dutch Elm Disease in the UK. The paper seeks to explain the catastrophic outcome of the outbreak, not only in terms of the underlying (and highly malign) pathology of the disease itself, but also because of an initially inaccurate scientific assessment of the nature of the threat constructed within a small but influential community of forest pathologists and policy officials."

    abstract = { Mathematical models provide a rational basis to inform how, where and when to control disease. Assuming an accurate spatially explicit simulation model can be fitted to spread data, it is straightforward to use it to test the performance of a range of management strategies. However, the typical complexity of simulation models and the vast set of possible controls mean that only a small subset of all possible strategies can ever be tested. An alternative approach—optimal control theory—allows the best control to be identified unambiguously. However, the complexity of the underpinning mathematics means that disease models used to identify this optimum must be very simple. We highlight two frameworks for bridging the gap between detailed epidemic simulations and optimal control theory: open-loop and model predictive control. Both these frameworks approximate a simulation model with a simpler model more amenable to mathematical analysis. Using an illustrative example model, we show the benefits of using feedback control, in which the approximation and control are updated as the epidemic progresses. Our work illustrates a new methodology to allow the insights of optimal control theory to inform practical disease management strategies, with the potential for application to diseases of humans, animals and plants. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Modelling infectious disease outbreaks in humans, animals and plants: epidemic forecasting and control’. This theme issue is linked with the earlier issue ‘Modelling infectious disease outbreaks in humans, animals and plants: approaches and important themes’. }

    abstract = { Sudden oak death has devastated tree populations across California. However, management might still slow disease spread at local scales. We demonstrate how to unambiguously characterize effective, local management strategies using a detailed, spatially explicit simulation model of spread in a single forest stand. This pre-existing, parameterized simulation is approximated here by a carefully calibrated, non-spatial model, explicitly constructed to be sufficiently simple to allow optimal control theory (OCT) to be applied. By lifting management strategies from the approximate model to the detailed simulation, effective time-dependent controls can be identified. These protect tanoak—a culturally and ecologically important species—while conserving forest biodiversity within a limited budget. We also consider model predictive control, in which both the approximating model and optimal control are repeatedly updated as the epidemic progresses. This allows management which is robust to both parameter uncertainty and systematic differences between simulation and approximate models. Including the costs of disease surveillance then introduces an optimal intensity of surveillance. Our study demonstrates that successful control of sudden oak death is likely to rely on adaptive strategies updated via ongoing surveillance. More broadly, it illustrates how OCT can inform effective real-world management, even when underpinning disease spread models are highly complex. }

abstract = { ABSTRACT The eradication of nonnative plant pathogens is a key challenge in plant disease epidemiology. Asiatic citrus canker is an economically significant disease of citrus caused by the bacterial plant pathogen Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri. The pathogen is a major exotic disease problem in many citrus producing areas of the world including the United States, Brazil, and Australia. Various eradication attempts have been made on the disease but have been associated with significant social and economic costs due to the necessary removal of large numbers of host trees. In this paper, a spatially explicit stochastic simulation model of Asiatic citrus canker is introduced that describes an epidemic of the disease in a heterogeneous host landscape. We show that an optimum eradication strategy can be determined that minimizes the adverse costs associated with eradication. In particular, we show how the optimum strategy and its total cost depend on the topological arrangement of the host landscape. We discuss the implications of the results for invading plant disease epidemics in general and for historical and future eradication attempts on Asiatic citrus canker. }

The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history, and conservation. Fraxinus excelsior is a large forest tree, native throughout the main islands of Britain and much of mainland Europe. Seedlings are shade tolerant, but adults are not so it tends to be an intermediate successional species, invading gaps in mixed stands rather than forming extensive pure stands. Ash grows on a wide range of soils but is commonest on nutrient-rich soils with a high base status and pH > 4.2, and is at its best on dry calcareous screes and fertile alluvial soils. Fraxinus excelsior is trioecious or subdioecious with male, hermaphrodite and female flowers and trees. Seed production is prolific with periodic higher producing mast years. Seeds are primarily wind-dispersed, but they can float and be moved considerable distances along waterways. Germination is delayed by dormancy until usually the second spring after being shed. Ash is tolerant of drought, but intolerant of spring frosts and so is predicted to fare well under current climate change scenarios, and indeed has recently been expanding in range in Europe. However, ash health and survival is currently seriously compromised by ash dieback caused by the fungus Hymenoscyphus fraxineus (Chalara fraxinea) that has the potential to kill all but a very few resistant trees. Moreover, the emerald ash borer beetle Agrilus planipennis, a serious pest of ash species in N. America, has reached Europe (though not yet the British Isles) and poses an equally if not more serious long-term threat to ash.},

It is a fast growing species, associated with several forest types and with a scattered distribution in many different forest communities. In this review, we sum up essential characteristics of European ash, relevant to the further development of silvicultural practices. The paper covers site requirements, regeneration and stand establishment, growth dynamics and wood quality, and health and robustness. The review also highlights implications for silviculture and summarizes new information on ash dieback, a phenomenon which is observed in many European countries. Ash grows best on fertile, pH-neutral, deep, freely drained soils and such sites should be favoured if the aim is for high quality timber. Ash grows well at wide spacing which can result in enlarged ring width and increased latewood percentage, making the wood denser and stronger. Relatively short rotations may be recommended, depending on site, to avoid black heart: for example, a harvesting diameter of 60 cm can be reached within 60–75 years at 60–80 ash crop trees per ha. Universal recommendations are therefore for wide spacing with heavy, regular thinning in order to get a large diameter within a relatively short rotation. The necessity for pruning depends on the stand density at establishment and the subsequent thinning regime.}",

	Abstract = {One of the main uses of an epidemic model is to predict the scale of an outbreak from the first few cases. In a homogeneous and non-spatial model there is a straightforward relationship between the basic reproductive ratio, R(0), and the final epidemic size; however when there is a significant spatial component to disease spread and the population is heterogeneous predicting how the epidemic size varies with the initial source of infection is far more complex. Here we use a well-developed spatio-temporal model of the spread of foot-and-mouth disease, parameterized to match the 2001 UK outbreak, to address the relationship between the scale of the epidemic and the nature of the initially infected farm. We show that there is considerable heterogeneity in both the likelihood of a epidemic and the epidemic impact (total number of farms losing livestock to either infection or control) and that these two elements are best captured by measurements at different spatial scales. The likelihood of an epidemic can be predicted from a knowledge of the reproduction ratio of the initial farm (R(i)), whereas the epidemic impact conditional on an epidemic occurring is best predicted by averaging the second-generation reproduction ratio (R(i)((2))) in a 58 km ring around the infected farm. Combining these two predictions provides a good assessment of both the local and larger-scale heterogeneities present in this complex system.},

abstract = "For beginners: This review tries to explain percolation through the cluster properties; it can also be used as an introduction to critical phenomena at other phase transitions for readers not familiar with scaling theory. In percolation each site of a periodic lattice is randomly occupied with probability p or empty with probability 1−p. An s-cluster is a group of s occupied sites connected by nearest-neighbor distances; the number of empty nearest neighbors of cluster sites is the perimeter t. For p above pc also one infinite cluster percolates through the lattice. How do the properties of s-clusters depend on s, and how do they feel the influence of the phase transition at p = pc? The answers to these questions are given by various methods (in particular computer simulations) and are interpreted by the so-called scaling theory of phase transitions. The results presented here suggest a qualitative difference of cluster structures above and below pc: Above p c some cluster properties suggest the existence of a cluster surface varying as s23 in three dimensions, but below pc these “surface” contributions are proportional to s. We suggest therefore that very large clusters above pc (but not at and below pc) behave like large clusters of Swiss cheese: Inspite of many internal holes the overall cluster shape is roughly spherical, similar to raindrops. For experts: Scaling theory suggests for large clusters near the percolation threshold pc that the average cluster numbers n s vary as s−τƒ(z), with z ≡ (p − pc)sσ. Analogously the average cluster perimeter is ts = s · (1 − p)/p + sσ · ψ1(z), the average cluster radius Rs varies as sσv · R1(z), and the density profile Ds(r), which depends also on the distance r from the cluster center, varies as s−1δ· D̃1(rs−σv, z). These assumptions relate the seven critical exponents α,β,γ,δ,v,σ,τ in d dimensions through the well-known five scaling laws 2 − α = γ + 2β = βδ + β = dv = β + 1σ = (τ − 1)/σ, leaving only two exponents as independent variables to be fitted by “experiment” and not predicted by scaling theory. For the lattice “animals”, i.e. the number gst of geometrically different cluster configurations, a modified scaling assumption is derived: gstsst1/(s + t)s + 1 ∝ s−τ−12 · ƒ(z), with z ∝ (ac − t/s)sσ and ac = (1 − pc)/pc. All these expressions are variants of the general scaling idea for second-order phase transitions that a function g(x,y) of two critical variables takes the homogeneous form xcG(x/yb) near the critical point, with two free exponents b and c and a scaling function G of a single variable. These assumptions, which may be regarded as generalizations of the Fisher droplet model, are tested “experimentally” by Monte Carlo simulation, series expansion, renormalization group technique, and exact inequalities. In particular, detailed Monte Carlo evidence of Hoshen et al. and Leath and Reich is presented for the scaling of cluster numbers in two and three dimensions. If the cluster size s goes to infinity at fixed concentration p, not necessarily close to pc, three additional exponents ξ, θ, ϱ are defined by: cluster numbers ∝ s−θ exp(−const · sξ) and cluster radii ∝ sϱ. These exponents are different on both sides of the phase transition; for example ξ(p < pc) = 1 and ξ(p > pc) = 1 − 1/d was found from inequalities, series and Monte Carlo data. The behavior of θ and of ϱ(p < pc) remains to be explained by scaling theory. This article does not cover experimental applications, correlation functions and “classical” (mean field, Bethe lattice, effective medium) theories. For the reader to whom this abstract is too short and the whole article is too long we recommend sections 1 and 3."

As such, it includes a discussion of scaling relations between critical exponents and their calculation using series expansion methods. Renormalisation group techniques are also considered. The major difference between percolation and other phase transition models is the absence of a Hamiltonian. Instead, the theory is based entirely on probabilistic arguments. A discussion of the connections with classical probability theory is also given.}

We work on a lattice with random bond strengths and show that with strong heterogeneity, i.e. a wide range of variation of susceptibility, patchiness in the spread of the epidemic is very likely, and the criterion for epidemic outbreak depends strongly on the heterogeneity. These results are qualitatively different from those of standard models in epidemiology, but correspond to real effects. We suggest that heterogeneity in the epidemic will affect the phylogenetic distance distribution of the disease-causing organisms. We also investigate small world lattices, and show that the effects mentioned above are even stronger."

abstract = { ABSTRACT Dothistroma needle blight is a serious foliar disease in Australian Pinus radiata plantations causing defoliation, decreased productivity and, in extreme cases, tree death. Conventional methods of monitoring forest health such as aerial survey and ground assessments are labor intensive, time consuming, and subjective. Remote sensing provides a synoptic view of the canopy and can indicate areas affected by damaging agents such as pests and pathogens. Hyperspectral airborne remote sensing imagery (CASI-2) was acquired over pine stands in southern New South Wales, Australia which had been ground assessed and ranked on an individual tree basis, according to the extent of Dothistroma needle blight. A series of spectral indices were tested using two different approaches for extracting crown-scale reflectance measurements and relating these to ground-based estimates of severity. Dothistroma needle blight is most severe in the lower crown and statistically significant relationships were found between crown reflectance values and ground estimates using a ‘halo’ approach (which ignored each tree crown's brightest central pixels). Independent accuracy assessment of the method indicated that the technique could successfully detect three levels of Dothistroma needle blight infection with an accuracy of over 70\%. }}

Much attention has been focused on the potential benefits of corridors with little note given to potentially adverse consequences. A simulation model is developed here to study the effect of corridors on the survival of a metapopulation in the presence of a fatal disease that is spread by direct contact between susceptible and infected individuals. For the disease modeled here, a landscape of patches connected by corridors generally suffers fewer metapopulation extinctions than a landscape of isolated patches. However, under a narrow range of conditions, results suggest that corridors may dramatically increase the probability of metapopulation extinction. This occurs when disease-induced mortality is low enough to allow infected individuals to spread the disease, but high enough to reduce population levels to the point that random demographic and environmental events cause frequent metapopulation extinctions. This has important implications for the design and management of conservation reserve networks. Although discussion focuses primarily on conservation corridors, the model results apply to any management techniques that increase the movement of individuals among populations.},

The vector spreads only between hosts occupying the same neighborhood, and the number of hosts varies randomly among neighborhoods. Simulation of a spatially detailed model shows that increasing heterogeneity in host abundance reduces pathogen prevalence. Clumping of hosts can limit the advance of the vector, which inhibits the spread of infection indirectly. Clumping can also increase the chance that the pathogen and vector become physically separated during the initial phase of the epidemic process. The latter limitation on the pathogen's spread, in our simulations, is restricted to small interaction neighborhoods. A mean-field model, which does not maintain spatial correlations between sites, approximates simulation results when hosts are arrayed uniformly, but overestimates infection prevalence when hosts are aggregated. A pair approximation, which includes some of the simulation model's spatial correlations, better describes the vector infestation frequencies across host spatial dispersions."

abstract = {Understanding biological invasions requires information on the history of spatial spread, as well as measures of landscape and biotic features that control habitat invasibility. Because invasive species often spread quickly over large areas, attaining these two sets of information simultaneously is uncommon. We studied the spread of a fatal nonnative root pathogen, Phytophthora lateralis, across a heterogeneous landscape of its host, Port Orford cedar (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana). Within our 37-km2 study area in southwestern Oregon and northwest California, Port Orford cedar populations are generally restricted to riparian zones along creeks. The pathogen is spread between watersheds in two ways: (1) by spore-infested material being dislodged from vehicles, and (2) by animals or people moving infested mud (i.e., via foot traffic). Using dendrochronological techniques, we determined the date of infection for dead cedars and reconstructed spread history across our study area from 1977 to 1999. Twenty-six of the 36 (72\%) separate infection events we identified were caused by dispersal via vehicles along roads, and the remainder by foot traffic. Survival analysis demonstrated that cedar populations in creeks crossed by roads were more likely to be infected than those creeks that were not crossed by roads. Also, a comparison of minimum dispersal distances showed infections that moved via road moved significantly farther than those vectored by foot traffic, and the distance infection traveled declined significantly through time. We also coupled our spread history with measures of landscape and host features, including abundance of potential host trees, the distance from the road surface to the nearest potential host, length of road in immediate contact with the riparian zone, catchment area (a measure of stream flow), elevation, slope, and solar radiation. Our results show that catchment area, host abundance, and proximity to the nearest tree are significantly and positively associated with infection risk. Our study demonstrates that increased connectivity between invasible sites created by the presence of roads can increase invasion success of a plant pathogen. We also document that successful pathogen invasion can be governed by both physical landscape features and attributes of host plant populations.},

This study monitored SNC disease in three Oregon Douglas-fir plantations bi-annually in 1998–1999, and compared differences in fungal colonization and symptom development in trees from north- and south-facing plots at each plantation. Fungal colonization as quantified by ergosterol content, pseudothecia density and quantitative PCR was significantly correlated with symptom severity (needle retention and needle cholorosis). All three measures of fungal colonization were highly correlated with each other; and only the ergosterol–pseudothecia relationship differed between plots, presumably due to the non-species specific nature of ergosterol measurements. Differences in symptom severity and fungal colonization between north- and south-aspect plots were consistent with climate differences. At low to moderate levels of infection, trees growing on warmer (i.e. south slopes in the western, and north slopes in the eastern Coast Range) slopes had higher levels of colonization, particularly during the winter months. Plots with southern exposures, which received greater amounts of solar radiation, had greater amounts of needle abscission compared to north-aspect plots with similar amounts of fungal colonization. As a result, greater fungal abundance and symptom expression developed on south-aspect slopes within the Oregon Coast Range.},

We report here on an investigation of the cause of this increased slope instability. Time since death of cedar was assessed using surveys around landslide sites. Root decay on dead trees was used to estimate the decline in the apparent soil strength provided by roots. Changes in soil hydrology were measured with 120 piezometers located in areas of healthy cedar, healthy spruce/hemlock, and sites with cedar decline. Relative influences on slope stability by changes in soil moisture and root strength were evaluated with a simple stability model. At most sites, soil depth is <0.7 m, and the loss of root strength has an important and possibly dominant influence on slope instability. In soils deeper than 1 m, changes in pore pressure have a proportionately larger influence on slope stability. Landslides appear most likely when cedar decline reaches snag class IV (approximately 50 years after tree death), when most of the cedar root strength is lost and root strength from secondary growth has yet to develop."

abstract = {Abstract  In October 1999, patches of dead and dying trees were identified in rainforest vegetation throughout the Tully Falls area in north Queensland, Australia. Previous incidents of patch death in the region had been attributed to Phytophthora cinnamomi. The distribution of P. cinnamomi was assessed by testing for its presence in seven sites displaying signs of dieback and seven sites that appeared healthy. Each site was a circular quadrat, 20-m radius (total area = 1256.6 m2). Within each quadrat, two perpendicular line transects were constructed. A single soil sample (250 g) was taken at the centre point and at 1-m intervals along each transect. All soil samples were tested for the presence of P. cinnamomi using a combination of lupin baiting, subsequent culturing and microscopic identification. Of the 1134 samples, 783 recorded positive responses. The mean number of positive responses was not significantly greater in patch death sites than in control sites, suggesting that at this scale of resolution the distribution of P. cinnamomi was uniform. However, at spatial scales of 1-m intervals across transects the distribution of P. cinnamomi was random.},

abstract = { Using a combination of replicated microcosm experiments, simple nonlinear modelling and model fitting we show that unexpected levels of variability can be detected and described in the dynamics of plant disease. Temporal development of damping-off disease of radish seedlings caused by an economically important plant pathogen, Rhizoctonia solani, is quantified, with and without the addition of an antagonistic fungus, Trichoderma viride. The biological control agent reduces the average amount of disease but also greatly enhances the variability among replicates. The results are shown to be consistent with predictions from a nonlinear model that exhibits dynamically generated variability in which small differences in the initiation of infection associated with the antagonist are later amplified as the pathogen spreads from plant to plant. The effect of dynamically generated variability is mediated by the interruption of transient disease progress curves for separate replicates by an exponential decrease in susceptibility of the host over time. The decay term essentially ‘freezes’ the dynamics of the transient behaviour so that the solutions for different replicates settle on asymptotes that depend on initial conditions and parameter values. The effect is further magnified by nonlinear terms in the infection force in the models. A generalization of the Lyapunov exponent is introduced to quantify the amplification. The observed behaviour has profound consequences for the design and interpretation of ecological experiments, and can also account for the notorious failure of many biological control strategies through the creation of ‘hot spots’, created by the amplification of plant to plant infection, where the control by the antagonist is locally unsuccessful. }

abstract = { This paper addresses the question of how heterogeneity may evolve due to interactions between the dynamics and movement of three–species systems involving hosts, parasites and hyperparasites in homogeneous environments. The models are motivated by the spread of soil–borne parasites within plant populations, where the hyperparasite is used as a biological control agent but where patchiness in the distribution of the parasite occurs, even when environmental conditions are apparently homogeneous. However, the models are introduced in generic form as three–species reaction–diffusion systems so that they have broad applicability to a range of ecological systems. We establish necessary criteria for the occurrence of population–driven patterning via diffusion–driven instability. Sufficient conditions are obtained for restricted cases with no host movement. The criteria are similar to those for the well–documented two–species reaction–diffusion system, although more possibilities arise for spatial patterning with three species. In particular, temporally varying patterns, that may be responsible for the apparent drifting of hot–spots of disease and periodic occurrence of disease at a given location, are possible when three species interact. We propose that the criteria can be used to screen population interactions, to distinguish those that cannot cause patterning from those that may give rise to population–driven patterning. This establishes a basic dynamical ‘landscape’ against which other perturbations, including environmentally driven variations, can be analysed and distinguished from population–driven patterns. By applying the theory to a specific model example for host–parasite–hyperparasite interactions both with and without host movement, we show directly how the evolution of spatial pattern is related to biologically meaningful parameters. In particular, we demonstrate that when there is strong density dependence limiting host growth, the pattern is stable over time, whereas with less stable underlying host growth, the pattern varies with time. }}

abstract = { Recent theoretical and empirical studies of the population biology of infectious diseases have helped to improve our understanding of the major factors that influence the three phases of a successful invasion, namely initial establishment, persistence in the longer term and spread to other host communities. Of central importance in all three phases is the magnitude of the basic reproductive rate or transmission potential of the parasite. The value of this parameter is determined by a variety of biological properties of the association between an individual parasite and its host and the interaction between their populations. The recent epidemic of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in North America and Europe is employed to illustrate the factors that promote disease establishment and spread. The frequency distribution of the number of different sexual partners per unit of time within homosexual communities is shown to be of central importance with respect to future trends in the incidence of AIDS. Broader aspects of pathogen invasion are examined by reference to simple mathematical models of three species associations, which mirror parasite introduction into resident predator-prey, host-parasite and competitive interactions. Many outcomes are possible, depending on the values of the numerous parameters that influence multi-species population interactions. Pathogen invasion is shown to have far-reaching implications for the structure and stability of ecological communities. }

The model incorporates parameters for primary and secondary infection mechanisms and for characterizing the time–varying susceptibility of the host population. A parameter likelihood is developed and used to fit the model to data from microcosm experiments. It is shown that the stochastic model accounts well for observed variability both within and between treatments. Moreover, it enables us to describe the time evolution of the probability distribution for the variability among replicate epidemics in terms of the underlying epidemiological parameters for primary and secondary infection and decay in susceptibility. Consideration of profile likelihoods for each parameter provides strong evidence that T. viride mainly affects primary infection. By using the stochastic model to study the dependence of the probability distribution of disease levels on the primary infection rate we are therefore able to predict the effectiveness of a widely used biological control agent. }}

The model has been used to determine tolerance levels for seed infection and to compare the effectiveness of chemical control measures based on foliar sprays and seed treatments. Reduction of primary inoculum, derived from infected seed, by disease exclusion through seed testing, or by chemical seed treatment will give effective disease control under British conditions (i.e. with an expected apparent infection rate (r) of 0.15 per infected plant per day). Under climatic conditions more favourable for the disease where higher r values would occur, control treatments directed against primary inoculum only would be less effective. Under such conditions, it is predicted that chemical sprays, which have no effect on primary inoculum but cause a reduction in the rate of disease increase, would be more effective. The most effective disease control, however, would be a combination of treatments.},

abstract = { In this paper we study the dynamical properties of models for botanical epidemics, especially for soil–borne fungal infection. The models develop several new concepts, involving dual sources of infection, host and inoculum dynamics. Epidemics are modelled with respect to the infection status of whole plants and plant organs (the G model) or to lesion density and size (the SW model). The infection can originate in two sources, either from the initial inoculum (primary infection) or by a direct transmission between plant tissue (secondary infection). The first term corresponds to the transmission through the free–living stages of macroparasites or an external source of infection in certain medical models, whereas the second term is equivalent to direct transmission between the hosts in microparasitic infections. The models allow for dynamics of host growth and inoculum decay. We show that the two models for root and lesion dynamics can be derived as special cases of a single generic model. Analytical and numerical methods are used to analyse the behaviour of the models for static, unlimited (exponential) and asymptotically limited host growth with and without secondary infection, and with and without decay of initial inoculum. The models are shown to exhibit a range of epidemic behaviour within single seasons that extends from simple monotonic increase with saturation of the host population, through temporary plateaux as the system switches from primary to secondary infection, to effective elimination of the pathogen by the host outgrowing the fungal infection. For certain conditions, the equilibrium values are shown to depend on initial conditions. These results have important consequences for the control of plant disease. They can be applied beyond soil–borne plant pathogens to mycorrhizal fungi and aerial pathogens while the principles of primary and secondary infection with host and inoculum dynamics may be used to link classical models for both microparasitic and macroparasitic infections. }}

abstract = "Thresholds are derived for the invasion of plant populations by parasites. The theory is developed for a generic model that takes into account two features characteristic of plant–parasite interactions: a dual source of inoculum (infection from primary or externally introduced inoculum and secondary infection from contact between susceptible and infected host tissue) and a host response to infection load. Each of the threshold criteria is shown to be the sum of the individual components for primary and secondary infection. This indicates that if parasite invasion is not possible through primary or secondary infection alone, when the two modes of transmission are combined, the parasite may be able to invade. The invasion criteria demonstrate that there is a threshold population of susceptible hosts below which the parasite is unable to invade. If there are nonlinearities in the population dynamics (arising through either the transmission process or the host response), there are also threshold densities for the infected hosts and parasite populations below which invasion does not occur. The implications of the results for the control of plant disease are discussed."

abstract = { Emerging plant pathogens are a significant problem for conservation and food security. Surveillance is often instigated in an attempt to detect an invading epidemic before it gets out of control. Yet in practice many epidemics are not discovered until already at a high prevalence, partly due to a lack of quantitative understanding of how surveillance effort and the dynamics of an invading epidemic relate. We test a simple rule of thumb to determine, for a surveillance programme taking a fixed number of samples at regular intervals, the distribution of the prevalence an epidemic will have reached on first discovery (discovery-prevalence) and its expectation E(q*). We show that E(q*) = r/(N/Δ), i.e. simply the rate of epidemic growth divided by the rate of sampling; where r is the epidemic growth rate, N is the sample size and Δ is the time between sampling rounds. We demonstrate the robustness of this rule of thumb using spatio-temporal epidemic models as well as data from real epidemics. Our work supports the view that, for the purposes of early detection surveillance, simple models can provide useful insights in apparently complex systems. The insight can inform decisions on surveillance resource allocation in plant health and has potential applicability to invasive species generally. }}

abstract = { The bacterium Xylella fastidiosa re-emerged as a plant pathogen of global importance in 2013 when it was first associated with an olive tree disease epidemic in Italy. The current threat to Europe and the Mediterranean basin, as well as other world regions, has increased as multiple X. fastidiosa genotypes have now been detected in Italy, France, and Spain. Although X. fastidiosa has been studied in the Americas for more than a century, there are no therapeutic solutions to suppress disease development in infected plants. Furthermore, because X. fastidiosa is an obligatory plant and insect vector colonizer, the epidemiology and dynamics of each pathosystem are distinct. They depend on the ecological interplay of plant, pathogen, and vector and on how interactions are affected by biotic and abiotic factors, including anthropogenic activities and policy decisions. Our goal with this review is to stimulate discussion and novel research by contextualizing available knowledge on X. fastidiosa and how it may be applicable to emerging diseases.}}

% Review on definitions of R0
@article{perspectives-on-r0,
	Abstract = {The basic reproductive ratio, R0, is defined as the expected number of secondary infections arising from a single individual during his or her entire infectious period, in a population of susceptibles. This concept is fundamental to the study of epidemiology and within-host pathogen dynamics. Most importantly, R0 often serves as a threshold parameter that predicts whether an infection will spread. Related parameters which share this threshold behaviour, however, may or may not give the true value of R0. In this paper we give a brief overview of common methods of formulating R0 and surrogate threshold parameters from deterministic, non-structured models. We also review common means of estimating R0 from epidemiological data. Finally, we survey the recent use of R0 in assessing emerging diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenza, a number of recent livestock diseases, and vector-borne diseases malaria, dengue and West Nile virus.},

abstract = {The latent period is a crucial life history trait, particularly for polycyclic plant diseases, because it determines how many complete infection cycles could theoretically occur during an epidemic. Experiments in controlled conditions are generally used to assess pathogenicity and host susceptibility, and also provide the opportunity to measure the distribution of latent periods in epidemiological systems. Once estimated for one or several pairs of host–pathogen genotypes, the mean value of this trait is usually considered to be fixed and is often used ‘as is’ in models. This review contends that the latent period can display non-negligible variability over the course of a disease epidemic, and that this variability has multiple sources, some of which have complex, antagonistic impacts. Arguments are developed for four sources of variation challenging the assumption that the latent period remains constant: (i) daily fluctuations in host temperature (or other organ–environment factors); (ii) nature of inoculum; (iii) host stage or age of host tissues; and (iv) intrapopulation competition and selection for aggressiveness traits. The review is focused on the wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici, making use of empirical datasets collected during the first author's research projects and a targeted literature review. Such empirical epidemiological knowledge is potentially important for epidemiological modellers. While some studies have demonstrated that the distribution of latent periods around the mean value has consequences for epidemiological dynamics, it is shown here that it might also be important for modellers to account for changes in this mean value during an epidemic. These results may be critical for improving epidemic forecasting.},
