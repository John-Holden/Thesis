Aims:
    1: Set up, and describe, the non-local dispersal model in chapter
    2: Give insight into how R0 under changes with both temporal and spatial scale
    3: Show that reducing tree density, ahead of a wave-front, can slow and even contain the spread.

MVP:
    1. Construct model from first principles
        - show stochastic time-series
        - show simulation frames
    2. Ensemble-averaged parameter sweeps of Gaussian dispersal model
        - mortality, distance reached/velocity/ probability of survival/percolation
        - density variations
        - \beta variations
        - \ell and \beta variations
    3. R0-idealistic derivation for Gaussian model
        - mathematical derivation 
        - show behaviour over
    4. R0-contact-traced derivations for Gaussian model 
    5. Power-law spread, a comparison to Gaussian
    6. Density reduction for control
