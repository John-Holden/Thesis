Aims:
    1: Set up, and describe, the non-local dispersal model in chapter
    2: Give insight into how R0 under changes with both temporal and spatial scale
    3: Show that reducing tree density, ahead of a wave-front, can slow and even contain the spread.

MVP/steal thread:
    1. Construct SIR model from first principles (small 25m \ell) i.e. generalise ch3-4 to include dispersal 5-10 pages
        - outline probability of transition(s) 
        - show stochastic time-series
        - show simulation frames
        - show that with a smaller value of \ell we essentially get back the percolation-based SLM
    1.1. Ensemble-averaged parameter sweeps of Gaussian dispersal model
        - mortality, distance reached/velocity/ probability of survival/percolation
        - density variations
        - \beta variations
        whys : 1) show that a small value ell will give back a model of the SLM 
               2) highlights the importance of modelling a type of pathogen water course, wind borne, soil etc
    2. Increasing dispersal  2 pages
        - show that upping dispersal parameters in this model requires a smaller \beta and motivates normalised/auxiliary beta
        - fit to SIR model and demonstrate the spread is more diffuse
        whys : 1) this shows section highlights the difference in model behaviour when ell is large 
               2) shows that beta must be changed to accommodate changes in ell -> normalized beta
    4. R0 3-4 pages
        - derive R0 with idealistic upper bound expression
        - show that it overestimates the spread when compared to probability of survival 
    4.1 Contact tracing R0
        - show that contact tracing R0 now describes the spread more reliably 
    4.2 R0 and scale? 
        - show that R0 is a function of time and space, that later generations will under estimate R0, first generations will over-estimate
        - show that a small domain will under-estimate R0
        - show that a large domain will saturate the estimate of R0

    3. Power-law spread, perhaps use a Cauchy distribution, something not a LDD as ch6?
        (Do I include...?, showing that distance 
        - explore the scale parameter and the exponent
        - show that for the same value of R0 exponent and scale parameter combinations yield a faster spread
        whys: 1) power law spread is used throughout the literature
              2) demonstrates the difficulty in containing power-law spread 
              3) sets up chapter 6
              4) show a move away from percolation, and motivate need for R0 as a metric to compare different models

Results:
1) Including dispersal results density issues and essentially recovers wave-like spread of the percolation based model
1) For ell comparable to domain, can fit to traditional SIR
3) Construct notion of spatially-explicit R0 + contact tracing method correlates well to eventual mortality
4) potentially show that R0 needs to be measured from IC1 and larger domain (post-rationalise ch6)?
