Aims:
    1: Set up, and describe, the non-local dispersal model in chapter
    2: Give insight into how R0 under changes with both temporal and spatial scale
    3: Show that reducing tree density, ahead of a wave-front, can slow and even contain the spread.

MVP/steal thread:
    1. Construct SIR model from first principles (small 25m \ell)
        - outline probability of transition(s) 
        - show stochastic time-series
        - show simulation frames
        - show that with a smaller value of \ell we essentially get back the percolation-based SLM
    1.1. Ensemble-averaged parameter sweeps of Gaussian dispersal model
        - mortality, distance reached/velocity/ probability of survival/percolation
        - density variations
        - \beta variations
        
        whys : 1) show that a small value ell will give back a model of the SLM 
               2) highlights the importance of modelling a type of pathogen water course, wind borne, soil etc
    
    2. Increasing dispersal
        - show that upping dispersal parameters in this model requires a smaller \beta
        - fit to SIR model and demonstrate the spread is more diffuse
        
        whys : 1) this shows section highlights the difference in model behaviour when ell is large 
               2) shows that beta must be changed to accommodate changes in ell 
               3) motivates the need for R0 as a metric to compare different models
    3. R0
        - derive R0 with idealistic upper bound expression
        - show that it overestimates the spread when compared to probability of survival 
    3.1 Contact tracing R0
        - show that contact tracing R0 now describes the spread more reliably 
    3.2 R0 and scale 
        - show that R0 is a function of time and space, that later generations will under estimate R0, first generations will over-estimate
        - show that a small domain will under-estimate R0
        - show that a large domain will saturate the estimate of R0
    
    4.2. Power-law spread 
        - explore the scale parameter and the exponent 
        - show that for the same value of R0 exponent and scale parameter combinations yield a faster spread
        whys: 1) power law spread is used throughout the literature
              2) demonstrates the difficulty in containing power-law spread 
              3) sets up chapter 6
