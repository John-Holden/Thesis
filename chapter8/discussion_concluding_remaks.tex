Throughout this thesis, we focused on the development of generalisable and flexible models that could, with accurate parameter-values, be tuned to model a wide variety of pests and pathogens. This thesis is not concerned with modelling any one type of tree disease, and only towards the end did we develop biological specificity towards ADB. Therefore, an in-depth biological review of a specific organism(s) was beyond the scope of this thesis.


The scope of this thesis is vast, and subsequently relatively general, although I presented several key themes.

% Interestingly, the disparity between clusters-size, and the distance between clusters could be used to give insight into
% which spatial scale is the dominant driver of disease spread.
% The more sparsely distributed\textemdash and thus fragmented\textemdash the $R_0$-map, the more important LDD becomes as the driver of between-cluster spread.
% Crucially, accessing the relative importance of spatial scale between disease drivers would rely on a fitted value of $\beta$,
% and the knowledge that ADB is estimated to spread with impunity and kill over $85\%$ of ash in Great Britain.


%---------------------------------------------------------
% comment on lack of ADB modelling
% To demonstrate the method, four simplified compartmentalised $SEIR$ models of ADB were constructed, composed of different sporulation and dispersal functions.
% Given the threat ADB poses to European ash, and the resulting economic impact, it was surprising to find a lack of spatio-temporal modelling work in the literature.
% A lack of dynamic spatial-explicit ADB models most likely reflect its complex life-cycle and lack of epidemic parameters.
% However, only in recent years has the sexual reproductive mode become widely accepted as the dominant disease-driver \cite{https://doi.org/10.1111/ppa.12844, havnavckova2017direct}.
% In addition to the life-cycle of ADB, multi-scale parameters for ascospore dispersal have only been published within the last few years \cite{grosdidier2018tracking}.

% To define invasibility over the landscape, we relied on a spatially-explicit value of $R_0$\textemdash i.e the mean number of infections produced by the first generation of infected ash.

%---------------------------------------------------------
% relation of work to more commonplace Metapopulation models
% In the process of computing a value for $R_0$, several insights into dispersal-based epidemic progression and spatial-scale came to light.
% Namely, computing $R_0$ for a fat-tailed inverse power law dispersal kernel required a larger to domain-size in comparison to the thin-tailed Gaussian variants.
% A larger domain-size necessitated a lower landscape-level resolution (or equivalently larger patch-size) when forming the $R_0$-map.
% Thus to define an $R_0$-value in the framework, landscape-level patch-size needs to reflect the nature of dispersal;
% metapopulation-type models do not have this limitation. 
% Yet, at the same time typical metapopulation models are not predicated on small-scale epidemiological properties, 
% but tend to model patch-sizes on the order of $100\mathrm{m}-1\mathrm{km}$ \cite{large-scale-control, doi:10.1111/j.1365-3059.2010.02391.x}.

%---------------------------------------------------------
% generalisation to the approach
% In favour of parsimony, infectivity $\beta$ was kept constant over the entire landscape of Great Britain.
% However, epidemic severity of ADB is known to vary in response to either urban or rural environments \cite{marciulyniene2017can}.
% So in reality, $\beta$ may very well exhibit a spatial dependence.
% Likewise, including an index on, $\beta_i$, could reflect yearly changes due to climate change or habitat suitability\textemdash thus generalising the yearly infection cycles according to Figure \ref{fig:SEIR-transitions}.
% An attractive feature of the $SEIR$ model therefore includes the scope of its adaptability 
% and generalisations to our notion of $\beta$ could support more in-depth studies on spatio-temporal epidemic heterogeneity.
