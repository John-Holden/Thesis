Throughout this thesis, we focused on the development of generalisable and flexible models that could, with accurate parameter-values, be tuned to model a wide variety of pests and pathogens. This thesis is not concerned with modelling any one type of tree disease, and only towards the end did we develop biological specificity towards ADB. Therefore, an in-depth biological review of a specific organism(s) was beyond the scope of this thesis.
