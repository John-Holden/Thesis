# Thesis: Modelling spatio-temporal tree disease epidemics in Great Britain

Published [here](https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/31356/) 

Summary:
- Chapter 1: Introduction & motivation, i.e. why bother?
- Chapter 2: Literature review of widely known tree disease models, including compartmentalsed SIR, agent-based, PDE & statistical approches
- Chapter 3: Introdcues a simple two-parameter percolation model on a lattice (referred to as the 'simple lattice model' or SLM)
- Chapter 4: Expands the SLM to a dataset covering the Great BRitain
- Chapter 5: Develops the SLM to include dispersal, puts forward two methods of determining R0, an analytical expression & contact-tracing
- Chapter 6: Expands upon the disersal model of Chapter 5 to outline a compartmentalised SEIR model of ash dieback & puts forward a method of visualising risk across a landscape
- Chapter 7: Outlines a novel approach to controlling the spread of disease by using the risk-visualisation method put forward in Chapter 6
- Chapter 8: Summarisies the main findings & limitations of this work, and puts forward the next set of research questions
